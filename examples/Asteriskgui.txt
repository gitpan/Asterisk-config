Asteriskgui.pm is Dahdi::Config::Gen::Asteriskgui . Dahdi is included
with the dahdi-tools package:

  http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/dahdi-tools/

dahdi_genconf will use modules in the namespace Dahdi::Config::Gen to
generate configuration.

This module deviates from the simple generation method as employed by
other modules there: it handles more than one files, and it edits them
rather than generate them.
